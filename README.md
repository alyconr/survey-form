# SURVEY FORM ðŸ“°

This is a Free Code Camp survey form challenge where I can show and stand out my pure css and html skills, I used some elements to wrap 2 backgrounds and used elements for creating a dash to pain
a rectangular shape. Furthermore I used  a transition porperty to animate the shape I created before. Alson, I  use a Linear-gradient Css Function to  create a progressive transition effect between
two colors.
